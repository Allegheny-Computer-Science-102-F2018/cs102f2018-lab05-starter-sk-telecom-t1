CS 102 Project Proposal

Introduction : 

After conversing about potential project ideas the decision was to pursue coding a Scientific Calculator. A scientific calculator is used for many disciplines in mathematics, engineering and the sciences. This project is practical because it can be used after the class throughout the rest of the teams careers. As computer science majors there are many instances of math. As a bonus there will be an implementation of a graph/plotter.

One pro of using calculators is the technological knowledge. This society is always changing thanks to the plethora of ever-advancing technology. Calculators are also fast and accurate, which makes them a great complementary feature for students.The main con of the using calculators are complacency. Although calculators are able to quickly add, divide, multiply and subtract, students still can’t use calculators as their complete fall-back plan (Concordia room 241: Resources and tips for educators & students.2017). 

Motivation: 
The motivation behind this project derives from what of the projects would be used after the class is completed. The argument was that the streetwear bot would be used continuously, but the problem is that the bot doesn’t necessarily fulfill all the requirements for discrete structures. Yes it would be a fun project, but it wouldn’t take full advantage of what was learned in the class discussions. The calculator is something that can be used past college in professional careers and more than just personal use like the automated bot. 
The Python language has diversified application in the software development companies such as in gaming, web frameworks and applications, language development, prototyping, graphic design applications, etc. This provides the language a higher plethora over other programming languages used in the industry. This coding language will be taken full advantage of with this scientific calculator project (Solutions, 2017).  

Feasibility : 
The calculator with be coded with Python and use Mathematical functions, Function Declaration, and many widgets such as Entry, Label, Button, Frame, and Menu. Professor suggested we use a plotter, graph and boolean calculations. 

This project is perfect for the CS 102 class because it will be using many math calculations and it is coded in python. Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are not continuous. This project would therefore highlight what was learned in class throughout this semester.
