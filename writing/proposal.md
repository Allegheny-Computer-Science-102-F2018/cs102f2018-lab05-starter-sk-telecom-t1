CS 102 Project Proposal

After conversing with Professor OBC about our potential project ideas we had
decided to pursue coding the Scientific Calculator. A scientific calculator is
used for many disciplines in mathematics, engineering and the sciences.
This project is practical because we can use this after the class throughout the
rest of our collegiate careers. As computer science majors we will in many
instances always use math. As a bonus we could add a graph/plotter. We could use
our calculator to find types of correlations. We are excited to experiment and
expand the calculator functions.

The calculator with be coded with Python and use Mathematical functions,
Function Declaration, and many widgets such as Entry, Label, Button, Frame, and
Menu. Professor suggested we use a plotter, graph and boolean calculations. This
project is perfect for our CS 102 class because we will be using many math
calculations and it is coded in python. Discrete mathematics is the study of
mathematical structures that are not continuous. This project will display
what we learned in class throughout this semester.
