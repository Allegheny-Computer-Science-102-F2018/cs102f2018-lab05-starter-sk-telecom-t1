For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.



### Idea 1
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Create a maze game of sorts using graphs and graph theory. The user would be given a maze and would have to input which way they want to go in order to try to exit it. If they are able to exit the maze, they win the game.
This idea is connected to the idea of discrete structures from graph theory. It would be a fun way to show the connection between graph theory in discrete structures, computer science, and games.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
This idea is connected to connected to computer science because though Graph Theory is a discrete mathematics idea, it is heavily utilized in computer science. Additionally, to create this game we would have to code it in Python, which obviously is apart of the computer science sphere. We would have to use computer science concepts such as objects, classes, and more, to make this idea come to fruition.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
MLA Citation: Mondal, Basudeb, and Kajal De. "Overview Applications of Graph Theory in Real Field." International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology 2.5 (2017): 751-759.

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
"Various application of graph theory in the real field has been identified and represented along with what type of graphs are used in that application. The Authors tries to give a basic conceptual understanding of all such type of graphs."

5) How will this article support your idea?
Our idea would be using graph theory to create a game. This article supports our idea because it helps to explain that graph theory has more real-world uses than just in discrete mathematics alone. The article shows that graph theory can be used in biochemistry, engineering, computer science, and more. This makes it seem more feasible that graph theory could be used to make our game.
