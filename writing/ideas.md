For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.



### Idea 1 - Mo
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Cryptography tool for multiple types of ciphers. The tool would give you a selection of ciphers and possibly use multiple layers of ciphers such as the caesar cipher, atbash, columnar transposition and more

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
Encryption is a common aspect of security and privacy concern in the online world and here is a toned down and easier version of that

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05483.pdf
Shows an example of a more complex caesar cipher and some combined

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
"Caesar cipher is an ancient, elementary method of encrypting plain text message
into cipher text protecting it from adversaries. However, with the advent of
powerful computers, there is a need for increasing the complexity of such
techniques."

5) How will this article support your idea?
The articles contains the method and approach that may be similar to
implementing our idea.


### Idea 2 - Jeremy
Graph Theory
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
We to have a good grasp of Python modules dealing with graphs, so we plan to create a maze game of sorts  graph theory. The user would be given a maze and would have to input which way they want to go in order to try to exit it. If they are able to exit the maze, they win the game.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
This idea is connected to the idea of discrete structures from graph theory. Creating games are connected computer science, and it would be good to have the knowledge of how to do that, more specifically in python. It would be a fun way to show the connection between graph theory in discrete structures, computer science, and games.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
MLA Citation: Mondal, Basudeb, and Kajal De. "Overview Applications of Graph Theory in Real Field." International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology 2.5 (2017): 751-759.

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
Many problems of real world can be represented by graphs. In mathematics, Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.

5) How will this article support your idea?
Our idea would be using graph theory to create a game. This article supports our idea because it helps to explain that graph theory has more real-world uses than just in discrete mathematics alone. The article shows that graph theory can be used in biochemistry, engineering, computer science, and more. This makes it seem more feasible that graph theory could be used to make our game.


### Idea 3 - Jeremy
Automation
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Using python script for automation, this automation could be anything from automatically logging into your Gmail, to automatically checking websites for price changes. or using python to automatically make purchases online.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
 This idea is connected to computer science as some programmers consider  Automation as one of the most coveted skills a programmer can posses. With web automation, you can easily create a bot to perform different tasks on the web.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
Bots being new in the scene of modern communication applications needs to be categorized.

5) How will this article support your idea?
Making bots is becoming more and more prevalent. as more and more  things on today's web are becoming automated, we believe having the knowledge to make a bot is very important. As this can be useful for daily activity. Anything as simple as checking web mail, posting regular content, or getting info for other applications and saving it to your computer.


### Idea 4 - Dubs
Scientific Calculator
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
 Scientific Calculator in Python with basic GUI using Mathematical functions, Function Declaration, and the following widget, Entry, Label, Button, Frame, and Menu.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
Coded in python, uses math functions

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

https://medium.com/@adeyinkaadegbenro/project-build-a-python-gui-calculator-fc92bddb744d

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
These articles show the basic code creating python calculators and how to create a GUI

5) How will this article support your idea?
It gives examples of code and potential steps we could take

### Idea 5 - Dubs
Python Advanced Conversation(Chatbox)
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
To automate user-inputted conversation in python and further advance it into a chatbox

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
Take what we learned in lab3  and further develop it

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
https://apps.worldwritable.com/tutorials/chatbot/

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
To create a chatbox bot. introductory level chatbot techniques by writing software modeled after the dialectical capabilities

5) How will this article support your idea?
It gives a brief overview of how we would create the chatbox
