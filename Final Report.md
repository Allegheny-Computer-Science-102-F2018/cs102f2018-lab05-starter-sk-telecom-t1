#  “Scientific Calculator”

# Motivation
The motivation for this project stems from the team's collective majors or minors of computer science and economics. A calculator will always be needed in the field, throughout daily tasks and is essential to the success of a job. Especially since there is a common interest in data analytics there will be extensive numbers that have to be used with a calculator. The argument is that using a calculator doesn’t benefit the knowledge of the user, but in this technological era it has to be used in order to ensure the best results. The perk this project is that it’s a calculator that can be adjusted and customized. The scientific calculator uses discrete structure functions and is coded with python’s TKinter graphical user interface. None of the team has much experience with a gui so this was a learning process. That learning process is part of the motivation because the team wanted to try something out of the ordinary for 102’s final project. The customization of TKinter and it’s many different features was a common interest. TKinter was consistently top 3 in all of the lists for the bests gui’s to use for python in our research search. This made TKinter the best choice for this assignment.
